This reduces the cost of research and increases its impact for over 31,000 scientists at more than 3,600 academic institutions and 15 of the top 20 pharmaceutical companies that trust BenchSci to guide their experiment design.', ' Here At BenchSci, These Are Our Core Values ', 'Focused: We focus on what will drive the greatest impact at all times.', 'Advancement: We believe in continuous growth, and discovering new ways to do things better.
